## Description
Website of the student list Jura7park of the ENSEEIHT, a French engineering school. should be still alive [here](https://jura7park.fr).
Backend is written in Python with the Django framework. Frontend is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.


## Developpers 
[I](https://github.com/newtondotcom) am mainly the backend developer. I have also worked on the frontend but [Gauthier](https://github.com/Lighar/) is the main frontend developer.


## Context
This project took place during the 2023 winter semester (january and februry). It was a voluntary project and has been done in less than 2 months. 

## Experience
This was my first time using Django and I have learned a lot about it. It is such a powerful framework and I am really happy to have used it. Its main strenght is the easy database management. Django allow universal support with a lot of database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, etc.) and provides a simple admin panel to manage the database.
